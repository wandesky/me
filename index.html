  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Software Developer; an Applied Computer Science Graduate from Kisii University.
    <br>
    I write code for different reasons and in different languages; currently I use flutter for mobile development and HTML5 for web development.
    Occasionally, I still find myself writing code in C, C++, C#, Java(including SpringMVC), JavaScript and Python(including Flask).
    In the near future I expect to work with NodeJs. In the distant future, probably Laravel as well.
    <br>
    In the days when I am relatively free, I take on a few students whom I teach how to code.
